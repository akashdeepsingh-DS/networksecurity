# Network Security – Phishing Detection System

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to detect phishing websites using supervised classification models.

The system automates:
- Data ingestion from MongoDB
- Data validation & schema checking
- Data drift detection
- Data transformation using preprocessing pipelines
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- REST API deployment using FastAPI
- Real-time prediction via file upload
- System & model monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana

This project simulates a production-style ML pipeline following MLOps best practices.

## Business Problem
Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats. Detecting malicious websites early helps prevent:
- Financial fraud
- Data breaches
- Credential theft

The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies a website as:
- 0 → Legitimate
- 1 → Phishing

The system is designed to be scalable, modular, and reliable.

Pipeline Flow:
Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Data Transformation → 
Model Training → Model Saving → API Deployment → Monitoring

Each stage produces artifacts that are consumed by the next stage.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Ingestion
- Data is fetched from MongoDB
- Converted into Pandas DataFrame
- Stored in feature store
- Split into training and testing datasets

👉 Insert Data Ingestion Architecture Diagram here

2. Data Validation
- Schema validation using YAML
- Column count verification
- Missing value checks
- Data drift detection using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
- Drift report generated as YAML

👉 Insert Data Validation Architecture Diagram here

Why this matters:
Ensures data quality before training and prevents garbage-in-garbage-out.

3. Data Transformation
- Target column separation
- Missing values handled using KNN Imputer
- Preprocessing pipeline created using Pipeline
- Transformed NumPy arrays saved
- Preprocessing object saved (preprocessor.pkl)

👉 Insert Data Transformation Architecture Diagram here

Design Choice:
Using Pipeline prevents data leakage between training and testing.

4. Model Training
- Models trained:
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Tree
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Logistic Regression
    - AdaBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Best model selected
- Metrics computed:
    - F1 Score
    - Precision
    - Recall
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Model saved as artifact

Why F1 Score?
Phishing datasets are often imbalanced. F1 balances precision and recall.

5. Experiment Tracking (MLflow)
For each experiment:
- Model name logged
- Hyperparameters logged
- Train & Test metrics logged
- Confusion matrix saved
- Model artifact saved

This enables reproducibility and comparison between models.

6. API Deployment (FastAPI)
- /train -> triggers full training pipeline
- /predict → uploads CSV and returns predictions

Swagger UI:

7. Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)

The system exposes metrics to monitor both system health and model behavior.

System Metrics
- Total prediction requests
- Failed prediction requests
- Error Rate %
- Prediction latency (P95)

Model Metrics
- Count of predicted class 0 (Legitimate)
- Count of predicted class 1 (Phishing)
- Predicted class 1 share %
- Percentage distribution of predictions

Grafana dashboard visualizes these metrics in real time.
This helps detect:
- Service instability
- Increased error rate
- Prediction drift

## Model Evaluation

Metrics Used:
- F1 Score
- Precision
- Recall

Evaluation results stored in ClassificationMetricArtifact for:
- Training data
- Testing data

## Technical Highlights

- Modular pipeline architecture
- Artifact-based communication
- Custom exception handling
- Centralized logging
- Config-driven design
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Prometheus & Grafana monitoring
- FastAPI-based inference service
- Model + Preprocessor separation
